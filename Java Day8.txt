Access Modifiers
________________
	Access modifiers defines which functions and fields can be accessed and not accessed in the class.
The function/methods, fields in the class can be given access to be used in other class by the access modifier.

Types of access modifiers
1.Public
2.Private
3.Protected

_________
 1.Public
_________
	Main function must always be public and static i.e. (public static void main) because compiler wants to access main function to run the  
code under the main function.
Public means that any package and any file in any project can access the public static main function.
Java compiler will call the main function to run the code under it. 
Java compiler itself is a different software but it can access the public main function.
If public access modifier is given to any function that function can be accessed in any class and method.

program
_______
class app{
 String name;
 int rollno;
  public void display(){
   System.out.println(name);
   System.out.println(rollno);
  }
  public void setValues(String str, int num){
   name=str;
   rollno=num; 
  }
}

class main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
     app hari.new app();
     hari.name="Hari";
     hari.rollno=69;
     hari.display();


     app Kishore=new app();
     Kishore.setValues("pon", 55);
     Kishore.display()
  }

}

output
_______
Hari
69
po
55


__________
 2.Private
__________
	Private access modifier makes the function/fields to be accessed under the particular class and makes it private only for the class in  
which methods/fields are written.

program
_______
program
_______
class app{
 private String name;//Here the string variable is set a private field
 int rollno;

  public void display(){
   System.out.println(name);//Private field is set as get function
   System.out.println(rollno);
  }
  public void setValues(String str, int num){ //set fucntion
   name=str;//Private field is set in another variable this is a set function           
   rollno=num; 
  }
  public String getValue(){//Returns name field inside the class this is a get function
   return name;
  }
}

class main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
     app hari.new app(); 
     hari.name="Hari";//error occurs because the name variable is a private field it cannot be accessed like this in another class
     hari.rollno=69;
     hari.display(); //In output it displays as null value because name value is not set her 


     app Kishore=new app();
     Kishore.setValues("pon", 55);//Here the name private field is set a str field so it can be accessed by only passing the arguments and the                            
                                    field is accessed in the class itself
     Kishore.display();//The name and rollno is printed without error
     String std1=Kishore.getValue();//name is returned as return type in this function but name is private field we can acces it using get               
                                      function
     System.out.println(std1+"=std2");//We can also manipulate the private field using this get function
  }

}

output
______
null
69
pon
55
pon=std2


_____________
 3.Protected
_____________
	By using protected access modifier only in the particular project file or the package can access the functions/methods, variable/fields.
Difference between public and protected is that in public access modifier all the packages and files can access the public data but in protected  
access modifier only the particular package or file can access the protected variable or methods.

	protected access modifier is beefily used in inheritance.


___________
 4.Default
__________
	If access modifier is not specified then the default access modifier is applied. 
Which make that only the package can use the variable, class, methods. Other package cannot be access the class, methods and variable if default  
access modifier is applied.
